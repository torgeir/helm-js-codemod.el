;;; Commentary:

;; A helm interface for js-codemod - running mods on current sentence or
;; selected region. Run `helm-js-codemod' to list mods in
;; `helm-js-codemod-mod-dir' to run on the current sentence or the selected
;; region.

;;; Code:

(require 'helm-core)
(require 'js-codemod)

(defvar helm-js-codemod-mod-dir nil "Folder to read mods from.")

(defvar helm-js-codemod--no-mods-msg
  "No mods found. Set `helm-js-codemod-mod-dir' to the directory of your codemods and try again."
  "Msg shown when no mods are found.")

(defun helm-js-codemod--candidates ()
  "Candidate mods to run for the selected region. List files in `helm-js-codemod-mod-dir', expect `.' and `..'."
  (if (null helm-js-codemod-mod-dir)
      (list helm-js-codemod--no-mods-msg)
    (delete "."
            (delete ".."
                    (directory-files helm-js-codemod-mod-dir)))))

(defun helm-js-codemod--run (mod)
  "Run js-codemod on region, with the full path of the selected `MOD'."
  (js-codemod-mod-region (region-beginning)
                         (region-end)
                         (concat helm-js-codemod-mod-dir mod)))

(defvar helm-js-codemod--source
  (helm-build-sync-source "Execute codemod"
    :candidates #'helm-js-codemod--candidates
    :action #'helm-js-codemod--run)
  "Source to list available mods.")

(defun helm-js-codemod ()
